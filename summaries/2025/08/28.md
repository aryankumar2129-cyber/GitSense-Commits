# Activity Summary for 8/28/2025

## 11:30:41 AM
The log shows development of an authentication system with frontend and backend components.

**Auth_Backend (d:\user\uba\sso\Auth_Backend):**

* **passport.js (8/28/2025, 10:30:48 AM):** This file sets up authentication strategies using Passport.js, incorporating local, Google, and JWT strategies.  No changes were made after the initial commit.

* **auth.controller.js (Multiple Revisions, 8/28/2025, 10:31:08 AM - 11:05:43 AM):** This file contains controllers for user signup, login, and logout.  The `userSignUp` function handles new user registration, including password hashing with bcrypt and user creation using Prisma ORM. `userLogin` manages user login, generating access and session tokens with a custom `generateToken` function, and setting cookies.  `logout` clears the access token and session ID cookies.  Significant changes involved:
    * Initially, only basic login and logout functionality was present.
    * Subsequent revisions added error handling, improved cookie management, and the addition of a `verifyEmail` function.
    *  The `verifyEmail` function went through several iterations, evolving from an empty function to one that checks if an email exists in the database and finally to a function that checks if the email ends with "@livingthings.ai".

* **auth.api.js (Multiple Revisions, 8/28/2025, 11:01:41 AM - 11:02:04 AM):** This file defines API routes for authentication.  A `/login` route uses Passport.js authentication, a `/logout` route handles logout, and an `/email-verify` route was added during the development. The `/signup` route appears to be commented out.


**Auth_Frontend (d:\user\uba\sso\Auth_Frontend):**

* **SigninForm.jsx (Multiple Revisions, 8/28/2025, 10:57:41 AM - 11:00:04 AM):** This React component handles user login. It starts with a basic email input, allowing the user to proceed if the email is valid. Then, based on the email domain (@livingthings.ai), it provides options to continue with Google or enter a password. The login redirects to different URLs based on the source of the original request and makes use of environment variables for admin, support, and inventory URLs. The component was significantly refined during multiple revisions.  The most notable changes were:
    * Adding email verification before showing the password input field by calling the `/api/auth/email-verify` endpoint.
    * Initially, the  `/api/auth/email` endpoint was called. It was later changed to `/api/auth/email-verify`.
    *  The conditional redirection logic after successful login was implemented.

The overall pattern shows an iterative development process, starting with basic functionality and adding more features and robustness over time.  The system incorporates various libraries and tools for authentication, database interaction, and frontend development. The use of cookies for session management is evident in the backend, while the frontend deals with the user interface for login and redirection after successful authentication.


## 12:31:18 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the `auth.controller.js` file in the Auth_Backend directory between 11:58 AM and 12:06 PM on August 28, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on the `verifyEmail` function.  Initially, this function checked if a user exists and whether their email ends with "@livingthings.ai," returning a success response in either case.  Through subsequent commits, the function was refined to return a more detailed success response including a boolean property (`isLtUser` later changed to `LtOrgUser`) indicating whether the user belongs to the "LT" organization based on their email.  Finally, an error response was added for cases where the email doesn't belong to the LT organization and the user doesn't exist.

A single change was made to `SigninForm.jsx` in the Auth_Frontend directory at 12:01 PM, 12:08 AM, and 12:09 AM.  The updates in this file improved the handling of the Google login redirect URL, ensuring it incorporates the original redirect URL from the request for a better user experience and modified the response check for email verification.

The `.env` file in Auth_Backend shows changes in the database URL from a remote production database to `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/uba-db` at 12:28 PM indicating a shift to a local development database for testing purposes. The Google Client ID and Client secret were also updated.  No changes are mentioned for `prisma/schema.prisma`.


## 2:14:59 PM
The log shows modifications to `settings.py` on August 28th, 2025, at 1:23:11 PM.  This file contains extensive Django settings, encompassing database configurations (PostgreSQL, with multiple entries suggesting different environments like dev, staging, and production), email settings,  caching (Redis), Celery task management, and Google Cloud Storage (GCS) integration.  The GCS settings include credentials, bucket names, and access controls.  The `settings.py` file uses environment variables extensively, loaded via `decouple` library, for configuration flexibility across different environments.

The `.env` file, logged at 1:24:40 PM on the same day, contains various environment variables used by the `settings.py` file.  These variables specify database credentials, Redis configuration, SMTP email settings, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project IDs, bucket names, and GCS authentication details.  The presence of multiple database configurations within `.env` reinforces the idea of managing settings for multiple environments (dev, staging, and production) possibly hosted on different GCP projects and servers.  There are also URLs and authorization tokens related to bulk bill downloads.  Note that due to security concerns, specific values like passwords and API keys are not discussed.


## 2:40:40 PM
The log shows several code changes across various files in a React frontend project (`gradnex-frontend`) on August 28, 2025.

The `eslint.config.mjs` file underwent several minor modifications between 2:04 PM and 2:05 PM.  These changes involved disabling ESLint rules: `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` was initially set to "off", and later `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` was also set to "off".  The final modification to this file at 2:05:11 PM did not change the code from the previous entry.


The `CustomSideBar.tsx` component was updated at 2:05:59 PM and again at 2:06:22 PM. The second update added `menuItems` to the dependency array of a `useEffect` hook that synchronizes the active menu item with the current route. This improves the component's responsiveness to route changes.


The `JobCards.tsx` component received updates at 2:06:42 PM and then again at 2:21:13 PM and 2:22:29 PM. The first update is the initial commit of the component. The latter two updates involved changes to the prop types, specifically adding a type annotation to the `jobs` prop in the `JobCards` component to address a type error.

The `JobDetailPage.tsx` component was modified multiple times between 2:06 PM and 2:07 PM.  These changes were primarily minor formatting and added a `<ul>` tag to the Requirements section.  Additionally, the `useEffect` hook's dependency array was refined at 2:07:17 PM, removing the unnecessary `checkApplicationStatus` dependency for improved performance. A final adjustment at 2:07:58 PM added a comment to the useEffect call to explain the exhaustive-deps rule being disabled.

The `Profile.tsx` component saw significant changes between 2:08 PM and 2:09 PM.  A `ProfileSideBar` component was added, creating a side panel for editing the user profile.  The main `Profile` component was restructured with a content grid layout, incorporating resume upload functionality, and the component is split into two parts Profile component and ProfileSideBar component. These changes involved adding input fields for various profile details and social links, along with functionality to update the profile through a store (`useProfileStore`). The update at 2:08:50 PM removes unnecessary code, and the final update at 2:09:40 PM doesn't change anything.

The `interviews\page.tsx` file was updated at 2:10:03 PM, adding styling, components and functionalities.

The `useProfileStore.ts` file underwent several revisions between 2:12 PM and 2:15 PM. The primary changes were additions and refinements to the `Profile` interface to include more detailed information (phone number), and the `SocialLinks` interface to include a website field. Additionally, `StreaksData` was updated to include a `longest` property, the default values for user profile were changed, and email was added as a part of profile data.

The `useSpeechToText.ts` hook saw refinements at 2:17 PM and 2:18 PM. The changes involved updating the type of `SpeechRecognition` in the global interface declaration.

The `useSpeechToTextSimple.ts` hook was updated at 2:19 PM.  The changes appear to be minor adjustments and added console.log statements for debugging purposes.


Finally, the `studentDashboard\page.tsx` file was updated at 2:22:40 PM.  This involved adding a conditional rendering for a message indicating the login provider.  This file imports components such as `JobCards` and `CourseCards`.


## 4:37:23 PM
The log shows several code changes between 4:06 PM and 4:36 PM on August 28, 2025, primarily focused on `d:\user\uba\sso\Auth_Frontend\lib\getRedirectUrl.js` and `d:\user\uba\sso\Auth_Frontend\src\components\SigninForm.jsx`.

Initially, `getServiceUrl.js` (4:06 PM) and `getRedirectUrl.js` (4:07 PM) contained identical functions that redirect users based on the `redirectUrl` parameter, using environment variables (`VITE_ADMIN_URL`, `VITE_SUPPORT_URL`, `VITE_INVENTORY_URL`, `VITE_SUPER_ADMIN_URL`) to determine the appropriate destination.  `SigninForm.jsx` was updated multiple times (4:07 PM, 4:07 PM, 4:08 PM) during this period. These updates involved refining the handling of redirect URLs after successful login, using the `getRedirectUrl` function.  The `redirectUrl` parameter is now consistently used and stored in local storage. Error handling for login attempts is also improved by checking the response status before proceeding.

Between 4:31 PM and 4:33 PM, `getRedirectUrl.js` underwent several revisions.  The most significant change was the addition of a new environment variable, `VITE_WEBAPP_URL`, and a corresponding conditional check within the redirect logic. This suggests the addition of support for a web application URL as a redirect destination. The `.env` file was updated multiple times around the same time to include the `VITE_WEBAPP_URL` variable, ultimately setting it to `https://uba.livingthings.dev`.

Finally, `SigninForm.jsx` was updated at 4:36 PM.  This final update simplifies the redirect logic after successful login. Instead of directly navigating based on URL prefixes, it now always calls `getRedirectUrl` and uses the returned value for redirection or home navigation, depending on whether the returned value is "/home".  This simplifies the code and enhances maintainability.  The commented-out signup and MFA setup links in the component remain unchanged throughout the updates.

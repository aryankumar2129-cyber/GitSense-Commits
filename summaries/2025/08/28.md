# Activity Summary for 8/28/2025

## 11:30:41 AM
The log shows development of an authentication system with frontend and backend components.

**Auth_Backend (d:\user\uba\sso\Auth_Backend):**

* **passport.js (8/28/2025, 10:30:48 AM):** This file sets up authentication strategies using Passport.js, incorporating local, Google, and JWT strategies.  No changes were made after the initial commit.

* **auth.controller.js (Multiple Revisions, 8/28/2025, 10:31:08 AM - 11:05:43 AM):** This file contains controllers for user signup, login, and logout.  The `userSignUp` function handles new user registration, including password hashing with bcrypt and user creation using Prisma ORM. `userLogin` manages user login, generating access and session tokens with a custom `generateToken` function, and setting cookies.  `logout` clears the access token and session ID cookies.  Significant changes involved:
    * Initially, only basic login and logout functionality was present.
    * Subsequent revisions added error handling, improved cookie management, and the addition of a `verifyEmail` function.
    *  The `verifyEmail` function went through several iterations, evolving from an empty function to one that checks if an email exists in the database and finally to a function that checks if the email ends with "@livingthings.ai".

* **auth.api.js (Multiple Revisions, 8/28/2025, 11:01:41 AM - 11:02:04 AM):** This file defines API routes for authentication.  A `/login` route uses Passport.js authentication, a `/logout` route handles logout, and an `/email-verify` route was added during the development. The `/signup` route appears to be commented out.


**Auth_Frontend (d:\user\uba\sso\Auth_Frontend):**

* **SigninForm.jsx (Multiple Revisions, 8/28/2025, 10:57:41 AM - 11:00:04 AM):** This React component handles user login. It starts with a basic email input, allowing the user to proceed if the email is valid. Then, based on the email domain (@livingthings.ai), it provides options to continue with Google or enter a password. The login redirects to different URLs based on the source of the original request and makes use of environment variables for admin, support, and inventory URLs. The component was significantly refined during multiple revisions.  The most notable changes were:
    * Adding email verification before showing the password input field by calling the `/api/auth/email-verify` endpoint.
    * Initially, the  `/api/auth/email` endpoint was called. It was later changed to `/api/auth/email-verify`.
    *  The conditional redirection logic after successful login was implemented.

The overall pattern shows an iterative development process, starting with basic functionality and adding more features and robustness over time.  The system incorporates various libraries and tools for authentication, database interaction, and frontend development. The use of cookies for session management is evident in the backend, while the frontend deals with the user interface for login and redirection after successful authentication.


## 12:31:18 PM
The log shows multiple updates to the `auth.controller.js` file in the Auth_Backend directory between 11:58 AM and 12:06 PM on August 28, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on the `verifyEmail` function.  Initially, this function checked if a user exists and whether their email ends with "@livingthings.ai," returning a success response in either case.  Through subsequent commits, the function was refined to return a more detailed success response including a boolean property (`isLtUser` later changed to `LtOrgUser`) indicating whether the user belongs to the "LT" organization based on their email.  Finally, an error response was added for cases where the email doesn't belong to the LT organization and the user doesn't exist.

A single change was made to `SigninForm.jsx` in the Auth_Frontend directory at 12:01 PM, 12:08 AM, and 12:09 AM.  The updates in this file improved the handling of the Google login redirect URL, ensuring it incorporates the original redirect URL from the request for a better user experience and modified the response check for email verification.

The `.env` file in Auth_Backend shows changes in the database URL from a remote production database to `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/uba-db` at 12:28 PM indicating a shift to a local development database for testing purposes. The Google Client ID and Client secret were also updated.  No changes are mentioned for `prisma/schema.prisma`.
